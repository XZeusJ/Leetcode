## Max Area
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., anÂ , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Example**:

    Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49

### Approach 1: Brute Force

    
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
            int maxArea = INT_MIN;
            int curArea = INT_MIN;
            for (int i=0; i< height.size(); i++) {
                for (int j = i+1; j< height.size();j++) {
                    curArea = (j-i) * min(height[i], height[j]);
                    maxArea = max(curArea, maxArea);
                }
            }
            return maxArea;
        }
    };

**Complexity Analysis**
* Time complexity:O(n^2). For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
* Space complexity:O(1).

### Approach 2: two pointers
Use two pointers starting from each ends, move pointer pointing short bar towards middle, we can find max after two point meet.

class Solution {
   public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxArea = INT_MIN;
        int curArea = INT_MIN;

        int left  = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;

        while (left != right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                curArea = (right - left) * height[left];
                left += 1;
            } else {
                curArea = (right - left) * height[right];
                right -= 1;
            }
            maxArea = max(curArea, maxArea);
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
};

**Complexity Analysis**
* Time: O(n). 
* Space: O(1).
