 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard
 * such that no two queens attack each other.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * 
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
 * placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space
 * respectively.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 4
 * Output: [
 * ⁠[".Q..",  // Solution 1
 * ⁠ "...Q",
 * ⁠ "Q...",
 * ⁠ "..Q."],
 * 
 * ⁠["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 * ⁠ "Q...",
 * ⁠ "...Q",
 * ⁠ ".Q.."]
 * ]
 * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as
 * shown above.
